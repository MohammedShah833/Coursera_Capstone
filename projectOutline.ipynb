    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may already know, child obesity is a serious concern in most western counties and paticularly in the U.K. \n",
    "The U.K government released a report stating that 1 in 5 children in reception year (4-5 year olds) were obese. As children grow older, the rates of obesity increases. By year 6 (10-11 year olds), over a third of children were classed as overweight or obese. The obesity figures are around 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be looking at the boroughs of London in the U.K.\n",
    "I will be aiming to answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Is there a correlation between average income in a London borough, the level of child obesity and the types and frequency of venues in the borough?***\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be doing this for public health UK to see if the local authorities should limit number of business license’s it gives to certain types of venues in order to improve child health in their boroughs.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 32 boroughs in London with a population of 8.92 million people.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I can prove a correlation between average income, child obesity levels and the number of unhealthy venues in a borough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The local councils can use this information to limit the number of licences it grants to unhealthy venues in the borough, like fast food outlets and increase the spending on healthy venues like gyms and outdoor spaces like parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The local health services could also use the information to better educate the children in the boroughs with the highest density of unhealthy venues, on healthy eating and life style choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow the local councils and health services to improve the health of the children in its borough and improve the future health and wellbeing of the children, thus saving the councils and health services vast sums of money by tackling childhood obesity at an early stage before any of future long term health and employment issues start to have a serious impact on their wellbeing.
